# Dotfiles

## Roadmap

- [ ] Decide where to put nvim (in this dotfiles or in own repo)
- [ ] add install script to run on first setup
- [ ] add tmux/tpm to install
- [ ] add autoconfig of e.g. gitconfig [like here](https://www.chezmoi.io/reference/special-files/chezmoi-format-tmpl/)
- [ ] maybe add encryption for vulnerable files that will be added
- [ ] fix weather in tmux, maybe with Open-Meteo
